Version Control is Important:
-It will save a lot of time tracing back mistakes
-You can use it to record milestones for steps completed in your project
-Makes collaboration easy
-Use it to reord what changes made by which contributor


-saves you time thus making you more efficient

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
-You can save at logical intervals, when you have completed one feature or one logical step
-You might forget to save 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
-keep a milestone history of your work, log after you do it eac
-makes it easy to trace your work back
-can revert to last working state easily

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

-if i commit after every mini-goal acheived and if too many lines of code are not changed, i can find the point where the bug was introduced and compare the difference between the bug state and the state just before the bug was introduced
